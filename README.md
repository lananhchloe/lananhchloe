## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m an International Economics student who vibes with finance, data, and all the fun chaos of building things in tech. Whether it’s breaking down financial trends, cleaning messy datasets, or experimenting with new tools, I’m always chasing that “aha” moment.

Here’s what I’m into these days:

- 💸 Currently working on: finance-oriented projects + my minimalist portfolio website  
- 📈 Learning: Python, SQL and CFA
- 🤝 Open to collaborate on: fintech ideas, data analysis, and anything that mixes numbers with innovation  
- 💬 Ask me about: underground economy models, financial data storytelling, or building study-friendly workflows  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m powered by boba and late-night Arctic Monkeys sessions — peak productivity combo
